A simple sourcemod plugin to allow you to save your forward progress on a map.  This is primarily intended for jump maps where you don't want to constantly redo a map (though you should often, it's the best way to learn) but would rather work on forward progress.

It stores your progress per map so it should work with any rotation.

The two commands are:

* ```jp_save``` - Saves your progress point.
* ```jp_load``` - Load and teleport to your progress point.
